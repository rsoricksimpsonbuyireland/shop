<h2>RSO product type usage</h2>
  <p>We offer two types of RSO products with different strengths. Two active components of RSO are widely used for their benefits. Both types are used for different conditions.</p>
  <p>RSO is very effective against pain, but in the right amount. A lot of research done in the lab and with animals shows positive long term effects. In general, 
    the more cannabinoids your body takes, the better the results. 
    However, the recommended dosage with RSO products is to start with a low amount and gradually increase the daily dosage, 
    until the most desired results are reached. This allows your body to build up tolerance against possible side effects and simultaneously make use of the benefits of cannabinoids. 
    CBD can mitigate the side-effects of THC thus some patients prefer an equal amount of THC and CBD.</p>

    <h3>RSO type I ratio 1:1 (available in 1, 10, 30 or 60 gram)</h3>
     Type I component is classified as a low to intermediate effect and used for stress, sleep, chemo (during and after), epilepsy, Alzheimer, PTSD, MS and more. The equal ratio of the soft active component allows it to counteract the side-effects of the stronger component. A gradual increase in dosage (starting with 0.02ml) will help your body to build up tolerate for side-effects (mostly in the form of tiredness and sleepiness).

The larger part of the stronger active component is ideal for pain relief, however, a gradual increase in dosage (starting with 0.02ml) is required to help your body to build up tolerate for side-effects (mostly in the form of tiredness and sleepiness).

  <h1>Preliminary Clinical results based on patient interviews (Part 2)</h1>

        
        <p>Optimising therapeutic RSO use can be a challenge – for doctors as well as patients. Most physicians never learned about RSO in medical school and, according to a 2022 survey, few feel they are qualified to counsel patients about dosage and usage of such products. To assist anyone in search for more information, we conducted our own clinical study to investigate the effects of RSO products on various health condition.<br>
  The main purpose of this study was to understand the effects of short and long term RSO usage and help to improve future derived products.<br><br>
  The preliminary results were obtained from 156 patients from 8 different European countries that have filled an evaluation form about their use and experiences of RSO products.</p><br><br>
  
  <h3>Health Conditions researched</h3><br><br>

  <p>Patients who involved in this research had a wide range of health conditions. Related health conditions were combined as one group to allow a better fitting result. As such, all cancer types were combined into one group, this applied also for patients that indicated to use RSO to ease pain due to cancer. Other patients indicated to use RSO for various types of pain relief or chronic pain, therefore, all causes of pain (with the exception of cancer) were combined into another group. Patients that indicated to have suffer from depression, stress and/or anxiety were also placed as one health condition group.<br><br>

  Cancer was found to be the present for the largest part of the patients (26,4% or 29 patients), followed by pain (16,4% or 21 patients) and depression, stress and/or anxiety (14,5% or 16 patients) as seen in figure 4.<br><br>

  Furthermore, 7,3% of the patients used RSO for multiple sclerosis, 6,4% used it for sleeping problems like insomnia, 5,5% used it for fibromyalgia. Other users indicated to have used RSO products for arthritis, epilepsy, diabetes, neuropathy, spinal disorders, migraine, COPD, PTSD, Lyme, Crohn's disease, bronchitis, recreational use, sexual stimulation and more.</p><br><br>

  A staggering amount of 83,9% of the patients indicated that RSO products indeed did satisfy their expectations to use it for their health condition. 12,9% was not sure and 3,2% indicated that it did not met their expectations (see figure 5).</p><br><br>

  <h3>RSO product type usage</h3><br><br>
  <p>
  A recent 2020 study found that RSO improves blood flow to parts of the brain associated with memory and decision-making. MRI scans showed type II increased blood flow to the hippocampus, responsible for memories and the orbitofrontal cortex, responsible for decision-making. Researchers say the findings could be an important discovery for conditions which affect memory, such as Alzheimer's disease and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and could help better target therapies.<br><br>

  Table 1 below shows the average responses of patients that used RSO products for other health conditions.</p><br><br>
