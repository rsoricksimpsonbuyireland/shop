                <p>Cannabinoids are chemical compounds produced by the hemp or cannabis plant and there are more than 85 identified cannabinoids. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the most well known cannabinoid produced by the cannabis plant, and is the only psychoactive cannabinoid.  Of the 85+ non-psychoactive cannabinoids, Cannabidiol (CBD) is the most widely known. A cannabinoid acts on cannabinoid receptors in cells that alter neurotransmitter release in the brain.</p>

                    No I am not. We have nothing to do with Rick Simpson. Rick Simpson popularized the use of hemp oil for the treatment of cancer and other ailments. Contrary to popular believe, is that he did not discover hemp oil nor was he the first person to discover its healing properties (the early Chinese surgeon Hua Tuo (c. 140-208) is credited with being the first recorded person to use hemp as an anesthetic). However, his name is associated with the use of hemp oil as a cancer treatment, thus many people refer to hemp oil as Rick Simpson Oil.

                    <p>This is a challenging question. Please have a look at our <a href="preliminaryresults.html" target="_blank">Preliminary Results</a>.</p>
                    <p>RSO is very effective against pain, but in the right amount. A lot of research done in the lab and with animals shows positive long term effects. In general, 
                        the more cannabinoids your body takes, the better the results. 
                        However, the recommended dosage with RSO products is to start with a low amount and gradually increase the daily dosage, 
                        until the most desired results are reached. This allows your body to build up tolerance against possible side effects and simultaneously make use of the benefits of cannabinoids. 
                        CBD can mitigate the side-effects of THC thus some patients prefer an equal amount of THC and CBD.</p>
                        <p>Patients with MS and Epilepsy are often using strong concentrations of CBD ro reduce the number and strength of seizures</p>
                        <p>Others use tinctures for pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, inflammation and PTSD</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, a slow increase in dosage for all is still required to allow your body to build up tolerance. Our 1 ml syringe is recommended to start with before buying a larger volume.</p>
                    <p>In addition, reach out to your medical provider or conduct your own research online</p>

            What is Microdosing?
            </a></p>
            <div class="collapse" id="q10">
                <div class="card card-body">
                    Microdosing is a new technique of taking only small quantities of substances for therapeutic purposes.</p>
                    <p>For medical users, micro-dosing helps you achieve the benefits of the RSO, whether for pain, inflammation, neuroprotection, depression, or anxiety, without leaving you beyond function. By only using enough to achieve relief, without being overwhelmingly high, not only do you improve daily performance, but you help your medicine last longer and cost less, which is important since insurance has yet to cover the costs of RSO-related products.</p>
                    <p>When imbibing low doses of RSO, you don’t perceive you’re intoxicated but experience a creative opening that allows you to enjoy the benefits without the side effects. The idea of designing subtle yet profound changes within ourselves using a natural healing plant is an alluring aspect for many.</p>
                    <p>For recreational users, micro-dosing is just as beneficial. Sure, you can’t overdose, but you can over do it. By micro-dosing, you feel great without feeling out of it, and save money by not developing a high tolerance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Introduction to Microdosing 101, as taught by professor and chef Annie Nelson*.</strong></p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 1:</span> “Always, always, always start low,” Nelson warns. “If you’re not a smoker, I’d start with 1-2mg of whatever it is, 2.5mg at the most. That’s it, and don’t take anything else. Then set your alarm for an hour and a half later. Seriously, set the alarm, because you might forget.”</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 2:</span> “Think about what your goal is. Are you trying to relax or rid yourself of anxiety? Are you trying to get high? Are you trying to sleep better?” (More on microdosing for sleep in a minute.)</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 3:</span> “When your alarm goes off 90 minutes later, ask yourself these questions, and answer them honestly. How do I feel? Do I feel high? Do I feel the way I want to feel? Do I feel like I can function?”</p>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 4:</span> “If you feel unchanged after 90 minutes, you know that wasn’t enough—and next time you can try twice as many milligrams. So next time you’re trying 5mg of THC, but remember to set your alarm for 90 minutes again.”<br>
                    Nelson also had a side note for the sleepless: “For my friends who are using cannabis to help them sleep better, and that’s a huge issue, here’s my advice to them: Try a small piece, roughly 5mg, about an hour before you’re ready to lie down. When you’re doing this for your first time, do it in your own space. When you wake up later that night or the next day, take stock: Did you notice a difference at all? Check in with yourself in the morning: Do you feel any better than you normally do? If not, try a little bit more the following night—but not too much.”<br>
                    As the old edibles adage goes: You can always take more, but you can never take less.</p>

                <p>A (daily) dosage depends a lot from person to person (body weight, age, health condition, etc..) and thus we recommend everyone 
                    to start with a very small amount of 0.02 ml (or 1-5 drops for the tinctures). Gradually you increase the dosage until the desired result is obtained (e.g. pain reduction). 
                    Reduction in dose can also be taken to the previous amount should any undesired results occur. Your body eventually builds up tolerance, 
                    but it can take several weeks to get well used to this oil.</p>

                This is something you will need to ask your doctor. Most medicine is fine to use in combination with hemp based products, however, nerve affecting medicine should be avoided.

            Can I use your extract oils for my pet (dog/cat)?

            <div class="card card-body">
                <p>You might like to try our low tinctures on your pet first. However, if your pet experiences pain then it would be recommended to choose the RSO oil.</p>
                <p>The best is to start the dosage very low and slowly increase it, in order to see how your pet reacts.</p>
                <p>The administration for dogs and other pets is somehow derived from the dosology for humans. The dosology for animals is based on the weight, with a maximum intake of 0.03ml/kg a day (25-50mg of RSO or 5-10 drops from a tincture bottle).</p>
                <p>If too much hemp extract oil is given to a dog, then temporary drowsiness may occur. Additionally, too much oil, not hemp extract, can cause dogs to have an upset stomach and potential diarrhea.</p>
                <p>A link to a scientifically research done on the administration of CBD on dogs:</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2900742" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2900742</a></p>
                <p>The research conducted was based on a very large dosage of 45 mg to 180 mg of CBD. Following this research would mean a maximum drops of 18-72 drops.</p>

                    <p>We make sure that we add 10ml of CBD/Hemp oil inside a bottle, but it can appear less.

                        while we fill it up by hand (without using a high pressure automated equipment). 
                        Each syringe is measured by weight before it has been filled and after it has been filled. 
                        We make sure that at least 1,05 gram of hemp oil is present in a 1ml syringe and 
                        the 10ml syringe should contain at least 10,05 gram.. 
                        However, because the 10 ml tube’s diameter is larger, more air bubbles can escape when it is cooled off and the plunger still not attached. 
                        Still, even with the air bubbles inside, the 1ml syringe should contain at least 1,05 gram of oil and 
                        the 10ml syringe should contain at least 10,05 gram.</p>
